## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```


```
library(rvest)
page.source <- read_html("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)")
version.block <- html_nodes(page.source, "th+ td , th:nth-child(2) , th:nth-child(1)")
head(version.block)
version.block2 <- html_nodes(page.source,xpath = )

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
